# Welcome to our Brazilian e-commerce data by Olist BI and Data Science project! 🛒✨

Hey there! 👋 We're thrilled to share our project for the **Business Intelligence and Data Mining** module at UWE Bristol. This is our take on building a **Shopping Recommender System**—a fun and practical way to help customers find products they’ll love, all powered by data mining and machine learning magic! 🎉

## What’s This All About? 🌟

Imagine an online store where the system *gets* you—knows what you like and suggests just the right items. That’s what we’ve built! Our project dives into a dataset, uncovers customer habits, and whips up personalized recommendations. It’s part of our final-year adventure at UWE Bristol.

## What We Did 🛠️

Here’s the cool stuff we tackled:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

- Dug into the data like detectives 🔍—summarized it, cleaned it up (goodbye, missing values!), and made some awesome charts (think scatter plots and histograms) to spot trends.

### 2. Customer Segmentation 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

- Grouped customers into *buyer personas* based on their shopping vibes—how often they buy, what they love, and more. Then, we tied it all to smart business ideas! 💡

### 3. Shopping Recommender System 🛍️

- The star of the show! We built a system that guesses what you’d like to buy next, using tricks like collaborative filtering. It’s like your personal shopping buddy! 🤝

### 4. Evaluation 📈

- Tested our system with metrics like precision and recall to make sure it’s spot-on. Spoiler: it’s pretty great! ✅

### 5. Bonus: Sentiment Analysis 😊😟 *(Optional)*

- Peeked into customer reviews to figure out how people *feel* about products. Extra insights for the win! 🎯

## How to Check It Out 🔧

- **Notebook**: Our `.ipynb` Jupyter file has all the juicy details—code, explanations, and our thoughts. It’s the heart of our project! 💻
- **Data**: Uuçsed a dataset with shopping info (check the schema in the files!). It’s in `.csv` format if you want to peek. 📂 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
- **Group Contributions**: See our `contributions.txt` for who did what—teamwork makes the dream work! 🤗

### Running It Yourself? 🏃‍♂️

1. Clone this repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure you’ve got Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib installed (we’ve got you covered with a requirements list if needed).
4. Hit run and watch the magic happen! ✨
5. You can aslo open it in Google Clab although RAM may not be enough and some libraries have bad compatibility with it.

## Why It Matters 🌍

This isn’t just code—it’s about solving real problems! We explored how data can boost businesses, practiced teamwork, and even thought about ethics (privacy matters, right?). It’s all part of hitting these goals:

- Using data mining in the real world 🌐 (MO1).
- Building and testing smart solutions 🤓 (MO2).
- Thinking about the big picture—ethics and security 🛡️ (MO3).

## Thanks for Stopping By! 🙌

We had a blast building this, and we hope you enjoy exploring it as much as we did making it. Questions? Hit us up on Github or drop a comment here. Happy shopping (and recommending)! 🛒💖
